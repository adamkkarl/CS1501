Additional comments to the grader:

As implemented, the compression ratio heuristic for monitor mode resets completely with
the codebook. I also tried keeping the data before the reset and all.tar actually
compressed much better, so I included that data in results.txt. In order to run
this implementation lines 134, 135, 263, and 264 should be commented out.

Sorry about the inconsistent strategies between my functions. I started with do-nothing
mode, then used the code from that to implement reset mode. Then, I attempted to use
the reset mode code to implement monitor mode but I had trouble syncing up the codebook
resets. Debugging showed that expansion would always reset one character before
or one character after the compression algorithm, and for the life of me I couldn't get
it to sync up perfectly until I pretty much threw out the code from do-nothing and
reset modes and started from scratch for monitor mode.
